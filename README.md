# Machine-Learning
Machine learning course taken during my MSc degree at LSE.


Topics include:
1. Fundamental concepts in machine learning and data mining. The na√Øve Bayes method.
2. Evaluation methods, the bias-variance decomposition. K-nearest neighbours method (KNN).
3. Cross-validation, bootstrap, erorr measurement and parameter tuning. Feature selection. Regularisation: Lasso and Ridge regression.
4. Ethics. Mathematical modelling and data transformation. Handling missing data. Weighting and resampling.
5. Decision trees, random forests, bagging, boosting.
6. Support vector machines, kernels.
7. Neural networks: forward propagation, back propagation, gradient descent, activation functions, early stopping.
8. Neural networks continued: deep neural networks; an introduction to advanced neural network architectures.
9. Clustering: k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, density-based clustering.
10. Spectral methods: principal component analysis and applications; spectral clustering.
